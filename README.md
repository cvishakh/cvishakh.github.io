## Steps by Step Procedure
To try and implement your own portfolio using this simple UI, follow the steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine via HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/cvishakh/cvishakh.github.io.git
```

- Modify the content in the <b>index.html</b> file to your corresponding career timeline, photos, blogs, and projects.
- To add your academic and carer journeym, modify/edit `.\timeline.html`. 
- Add or remove images from `.\photos` directory as per your requirement.
- extract_metadata.py: Extracts GPS metadata (latitude & longitude) from JPEG images and generates a `photos_metadata.json` file for use in the photo gallery.
- To connect and publish your blogs, use `.\blogs.html`.
- Showcase your projects and works, use `\projects.html`.
- I highly recommend to use [Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to deploy the website as EASIEST WAY.
- To deploy your website, create github repository with your github username `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Please don't give any other name.
- Push the generated code to the `main` branch of current repository.
- <b>üí° Tip:</b> Make sure to set `analyticsId` from your Google Analytics account inside the Google Analytics script tag, if you want to use your own Google Analytics account.
